## Instructions
To run the pipeline, please visit the `scripts` directory and run the files in order:

1. `download.py`: This downloads external datasets into the `data/external` directory.  
2. `process_postcode.py`: This creates a postcode and SA2 lookup table and outputs it to the data/curated directory.  
3. `ETL.py`: This script reads raw data, conducts preliminary preprocessing and merges all data into a single data file.
